Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service,
identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security. Include justification.

Most poor practices are obvious violations to the least-privilege principle, which is a best practice advocated by AWS.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

# Poor practice 1

All security groups have defined CIDR ranges (i.e., egress and ingress) as 0.0.0.0/0.
 With such configuration, it will be opened to communicate from/to any IP. 0.0.0.0/0 means access from the whole Internet.

# Poor practice 2

The Web Service instance is in a public subnet when there is a private one available. The Load Balancer could be in
 the public subnet with the Web Service instance in the private one. That way it would be possible to have more control
 of whose accessing it.

# Extra Poor practices

 - VPC configurations have DestinationCidrBlock defined as 0.0.0.0/0, which would make it possible to share information
 with any IP in case there is a breach.
 - The created IAM role have full access to S3 resources. It should only have access to specific buckets and only to
 perform the necessary actions.
