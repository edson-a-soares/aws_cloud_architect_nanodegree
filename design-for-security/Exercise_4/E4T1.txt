# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

    - Update security groups to block ssh connections from all IPs
    - Allow login only with key file

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were
compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

    - Enable the least privilege access to S3 content: updating InstanceRolePolicy-C3 to allow access only to S3BucketRecipesFree.
    - Enable encryption through KMS for data at rest to the content of S3 buckets which allows only specific subnets to
    access the content
