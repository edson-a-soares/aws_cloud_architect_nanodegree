# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

    a. Scan infrastructure as code templates.
    b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
    c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.

    For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability that it might expose.
